BIG (.big)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't believe this is an acronym, rather a reference to the fact that by bundling
together lots of files you end up with one big one...

Homeworld combines a large number of the data files it needs into a single
compressed file. Such archives are given the .big extension. The main ones in
are:

Homeworld.big - original archive containing the vast majority of the game data

Update.big    - "corrections" to Homeworld.big. Provided by the 1.05 PC patch
                and also used by Raider Retreat to add the extra mission's data

Extra.big     - this is not a real .big file. It's a CD disc space "filler"
                created to try and prevent exact-copy pirate CDs because CDR
                drives available at the time could only write 650MB discs.
                Extra.big's additional 220MB took the total data size over that
                limit and so prevented a fair bit of casual piracy. For the
                record, the contents of Extra.big is random junk; there isn't
                anything to extract:

See tools/biggie for a means of listing/extracting files within a .big archive.

Bink
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A third-party video compression and playback library used by Homeworld for its
trademark between-mission black-and-white movies. Bink is licenced by Rad Game
Tools (http://www.radgametools.com) who also provide stand-alone player software
(http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BTG (.btg)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background Tool [of the] Gods!

The panaromic "sky" backgrounds in Homeworld are created with BTG (tools/win32/BTG
in the original source code released by Relic). This tool is currently Windows
only. The files created by this tool use the .btg extension.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GEO (.geo)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GEO[metry]

Geometry data for ship models etc. Tightly integrated with the LiF file format.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KAS (.kas)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kick Ass Script

Relic's proprietary scripting language for Homeworld. Missions scripts using
this language are saved with the .kas extension. These files are converted by
tools/kas2c into compilable C code which is then placed in the src/Generated
directory.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiF (.lif)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Layered image Format

This format is the image storage method for Homeworld. It is mostly used for
textures but also finds use for front ends graphics, cursor bitmaps and tutorial
button graphics. It actually has 2 general formats which share a common header.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-Interactive Sequence

The in-game cut-scenes rendered by the Homeworld 3D engine. Indicated by
the fade-in black-bordered widescreen effect.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raider Retreat
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raider Retreat was a special edition of Homeworld released as a promotion for
Homeworld Cataclysm. When Homeworld was originally released a mission that
previously existed between the fourth and fifth missions was removed because
it was felt to be too hard for beginner players. Once the existence of this
mission became public knowledge there was widespread demand from Homeworld
players for this mission to be released. Relic eventually relented and it was
distributed, along with the previous four missions, as a stand-alone CD to those
people who preordered Homeworld Cataclysm.

Source code required for this version of Homeworld can be toggled with the
HW_RAIDER_RETREAT #define. The data files required can be downloaded from:

RGL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relic Graphics Layer

A graphics API wrapper which allows the exact nature of how the graphics are
being rendered to be "hidden" from the main game. It wraps the APIs for
software, Direct3D and OpenGL renderers. Does the same job as SDL and could be
removed; the only caveat is that we would then lose the possibility of using
a software renderer. See:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SDL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simple Direct Media Layer (http://www.libsdl.org/)

A cross-platform graphics/sound/input API wrapper.
