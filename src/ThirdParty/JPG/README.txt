The JPEG library is written around the assumption that you will be dealing with files directly via a FILE *. Unfortunately, Homeworld also uses an alternative file storage mechanism, the .BIG archive file, which you cannot interact with via FILE *. Instead you have to use File's 'filehandle' mechanism. The original Relic team took the JPEG code and edited it directly to get the correct behaviour. That means that if you want to upgrade the JPEG source code to a more modern version you have to reimplement the changes they made. 

I tried to #define a way of making these changes whilst retaining the original JPEG code but unfortunately the headers are just not written with something like that in mind and "conflicting types" errors abound. So, instead, here's what needs changing when upgrading the JPEG code:

1) jinclude.h: include File.h so that the JPEG code knows about filehandles

   #include "File.h"


2) jinclude.h: change the JFREAD #define to:

   #define JFREAD(file, buf, sizeofbuf)  \
      (fileBlockReadNoError((file), (void *) (buf), (sizeofbuf)))


3) jpeglib.h: change jpeg_stdio_src's function prototype to accept filehandles:

   EXTERN(void) jpeg_stdio_src JPP((j_decompress_ptr cinfo, filehandle infile));


4) jdatasrc.c: change jpeg_stdio_src's function definition to accept filehandles:

   jpeg_stdio_src (j_decompress_ptr cinfo, filehandle infile)
